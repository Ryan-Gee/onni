            ONNI is designed for collaboration. In the era of digital information and communication, innovation relies on communication and teamwork. ONNI aims to provide social innovators with a platform to work together, share ideas, and inspire others to take on social initiatives of their own, in their own communities.

            Having the right tools is important for any job, so we wanted to provide social innovators with the best tool to suit their needs. ONNI allows creators to upload image galleries, files, and details about all their projects to encourage a culture of communication and collaboration.

            ONNI also allows users the ability to create "child" projects that take another user's idea and re-implement or expand on it, allowing every project's full potential to be realized.

            ONNI isn't just a boring online repository; it's a social platform designed around and for people who want to change the world. Drawing inspiration from other social media platforms, creators can like and comment on other creators' projects and ideas. This gives innovators the opportunity to engage and work together on social projects, and allows everyone to see how their work is changing the world.
